We would like to express our special thanks of gratitude to our teacher \textbf{Prof. Dinesh Kr. Pradhan} as well as our director \textbf{Dr. Pijush Pal Roy} and the faculty members of Computer Science and Engineering Department of \textbf{Dr. B. C. Roy Engineering College, Durgapur} who gave us the golden opportunity to do this wonderful project on the topic \textbf{Longitudinal Analysis of Microsoft Academic Graph (LAoMAG)}, which also helped us in doing a lot of research and we came to know about so many new things, we are really thankful to them.\\
\indent
We would also like to express a deep sense of gratitude and thank \textbf{Prof. (Dr.) Subrata Nandi, NIT (Durgapur)}, without whose permission, wise counsel and able guidance, it would not have been possible to pursue our training in this manner. 
Finally, we would also like to thank our parents, friends and others who directly or indirectly contributed to successful completion of my industrial training within the limited time frame.
